# libasm
Get familiar with assembly language

![mark](https://github.com/rubenoid/libasm/blob/main/libasm_mark.png?raw=true)

### Make
`make` to compile or `make test` to see the functions in action (read only reads first 1000 characters of main.c)

## Subject
- The library must be called libasm.a.
-  You must submit a main that will test your functions and that will compile with
your library to show that itâ€™s functional.
- You must rewrite the following functions in asm:
  - ft_strlen (man 3 strlen)
  - ft_strcpy (man 3 strcpy)
  - ft_strcmp (man 3 strcmp)
  - ft_write (man 2 write)
  - ft_read (man 2 read)
  - ft_strdup (man 3 strdup, you can call to malloc)
- You must check for errors during syscalls and properly set them when needed
- Your code must set the variable errno properly.
- For that, you are allowed to call the extern ___error or errno_location.

## Notes of interest
This lib only works on MacOS, but can easily be rewritten for Linux. You only need to change the syscall codes.
